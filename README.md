# HiveSSO Posting API

A Node.js application over hivesigner for the Hive blockchain. Check it out on [www.hivesso.com](https://www.hivesso.com)

# API

### Generate access token from code received after sign in

```
TYPE - Post
URL - https://api.hivesso.com/api/aouth2/token
PARAMS - { "code": `access code`, "secret": `app secret`}
```

### All other API's are hivesigner compatiable. Just replace the URL to api.hivesso.com and the access token. Rest is just same.

# Usage

# hive posting key for broadcasting account
BROADCASTER_POSTING_WIF=5JRPH...
# secret key to sign and verify posting access code and access token
```
